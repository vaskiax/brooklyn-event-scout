# PRD.md: Product Requirements Document

#### **Strategic Introduction**
The "Event-Driven Alerts" system is a proactive intelligence dashboard designed for businesses (e.g., restaurants, retail) in New York City. It provides early warnings and insights into upcoming events, weather shifts, and transit disruptions that significantly impact foot traffic and operational flow in specific areas.

#### **Problem Definition and Product Vision**
*   **The Problem:** Small to medium-sized businesses often struggle to anticipate sudden changes in customer volume caused by local events, races, or weather. This leads to inefficient staffing, inventory waste, or lost revenue opportunities.
*   **The Vision:** To become the "early warning system" for urban commerce, transforming complex web data into actionable business intelligence.

#### **Target Audience**
Local business owners, hospitality managers, and retail operators who rely on foot traffic and predictable neighborhood movement.

#### **Scope and Exclusions**
*   **Scope:** 
    *   Automated monitoring of Prospect Park and NYRR event calendars.
    *   Integration of National Weather Service (NWS) alerts.
    *   MTA service alerts for subway and bus disruptions affecting the area.
    *   Impact "scoring" system to categorize event magnitude.
*   **Exclusions:** 
    *   Real-time video traffic analysis.
    *   Social media sentiment monitoring (Phase 1).
    *   Direct integration with POS systems for inventory ordering.

#### **Transition**
This PRD serves as the foundation for the SYSTEM_DESIGN, ensuring every technical implementation aligns with the goal of providing actionable alerts.
