# MCP.md: Agent Control Protocol

#### **Strategic Introduction**
The NEIS Agent is an autonomous entity designed to bridge the gap between raw web data and business intelligence. It operates with a focus on accuracy, timeliness, and proactive alerting.

#### **Behavioral Principles**
*   **Proactivity:** The agent does not just collect data; it evaluates impact. If a major race is detected, it should initiate an alert sequence immediately.
*   **Accuracy over Volume:** The agent filters out redundant or low-impact notifications to maintain high signal-to-noise ratio.
*   **Transparency:** Every alert generated by the agent must link back to its primary source (e.g., a specific NYRR race URL).

#### **Agent Characteristics**
*   **Interactivity:** The agent can be queried via the API for "on-demand" impact reports.
*   **Autonomy:** The agent scheduled tasks for periodic scraping (Phase 1) and predictive alerting (Phase 2).
*   **Adaptability:** The agent adjusts its scraping frequency based on the proximity of identified high-impact events.
