# LEGAL.md: Compliance and Ethics Framework

#### **Strategic Introduction**
NEIS operates on publicly available data. Compliance focuses on respecting the terms of service of source websites and protecting user information.

#### **Web Scraping Ethics**
1.  **Respecting Robots.txt:** Scrapers must check and attempt to adhere to `robots.txt` where feasible, or use reasonable delays between requests to avoid server strain.
2.  **Public Data Domain:** Only publicly accessible event information is collected. No private user data is harvested from source sites.
3.  **Attribution:** The system maintains a link back to the original event source to ensure accuracy and proper credit.

#### **Privacy and Compliance**
*   **User Privacy:** The NEIS dashboard only stores business-related settings. No sensitive personal user data (PII) is required for core functionality.
*   **API Terms:** System must adhere to the usage limits and attribution requirements of the MTA and National Weather Service APIs.
*   **Geographic Accuracy:** All reports must clearly state they are based on available public data and are for informational purposes only.
